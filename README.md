I converted the audio files in .mp3 format to MIDI files to train the *__Recurrent Neural Network__*. 

## Why RNN?

Audio data can be viewed as a form of *__time series data__* where data points are plotted in a sequence with time values. This is evident from the *__spectrogram__* above which is a plot of frequency with respect to time.

## Model Building

Work in progress...
